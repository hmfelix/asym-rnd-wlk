# Two-barrier asymmetric random walk in Python (1D)

## Overview

In this project I solve a gambler's ruin game where both players can go broke. I propose a straightforward analytical solution and as well a numeric verification by simulation in Python. The game is equivalent to a two-barrier asymmetric random walk which has innumerous applications in physics, economics, and life sciences.

## How to access

I consolidate the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook file, which you can access [here](URL).

You can input your own parameters to modify the position of the absorbing barriers in the random walk.

If you wish to execute the file in your local machine, you need to have both Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Purpose

This project is part of a research exercise for my Physics undergraduate degree at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
