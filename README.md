# Two-barrier asymmetric random walk in Python (1D)

## Overview

In this project I solve a gambler's ruin game where both players can go broke. I propose both an analytical solution and a numeric verification through a Python simulation. The game is equivalent to a two-barrier asymmetric random walk and has innumerous applications in several areas of physics, economics and life sciences.

## How to access

I consolidate the analysis in a Jupyter Notebook file, which you can access [here](URL).

You can input your own parameters to modify the position of the absorbing barriers in the random walk.

If you wish to execute the file in your local machine, you need to have both Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

## Purpose

This project is part of a research exercise for my Physics undergraduate degree at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.
