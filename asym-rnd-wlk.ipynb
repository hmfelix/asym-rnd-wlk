For instance, XXXX thinks of the symmetric version of the problem ($p=q=1/2$) as a recursion with two boundary conditions and solves it as an initial value problem (IVP), analogous to solving an ordinary differential equation using characteristic polynomials. On its turn, XXXX displays the asymmetric version in the form of a telescopic series and solves it using the techniques of sequences and series, akin to an introductory course in Real Analysis. Going one step further into generalizing the problem, XXXX frames it as a Markov Chain with two absorbing states.\n","\n","Here I propose a more straightforward approach, much like a Physicist would tackle the problem for the first time without prior knowledge of the techniques above. The advantage is that only a very elementary knowledge of calculus and probability is required, such that a student in the middle of the first (STEM undergrad) semester is readily able to comprehend. For problem **(i)** my approach is somewhat similar to the one used by XXXX when modelling the absorption of particles by living systems in one dimension, consisting of decomposing the probabilities of alternate paths in a random walk. For problem **(ii)** I come up with an analogy with velocity that feels very intuitive for physicists.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Setup\n","\n","Denote $S_n$ as the money held by Player **A** during the $n$-th play. Since players are transferring to each other from a finite resource pool, they share the constraint that the sum of resources in the game is $150$ BRL + $80$ BRL $= 230$ BRL, so Player **B**'s account is simply $230$ BRL $- S_n $.\n","\n","The process of solution is made much easier if we scale the problem by units of 10 BRL, such that 10 BRL = 1 monetary unit.\n","\n","With this setup, the state of the system can be described by the sole number $S_n$, which starts at $S_0=15$ and ranges from 0 (where **A** is broke) to 23 (where **B** is broke). Displaying all the possible states in order (interval $[0,23]$ on the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$) and plotting position $S_n$ against duration $n$ of the game (interval $[0,N]$ with $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}$), we can visualize $S_n$ as the position in a random walk as in the example run below:\n","\n","**FIG EXEMPLO**\n","\n","In such setup, each $i$-th step $X_i$ (money transfer) equals 1 unit to the right or to the left, that is $X_i \\in \\{-1,1\\}$, and $X_i$ is a random variable. Since position $S_n$ is a function of $X_i$, it is also a random variable."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Solution to question **(i)**\n","\n","Using the setup above, question **(i)** can be thought of as finding the mean (expectation) of the probability distribution ...."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["\n","\n","\n","\n","## Python simulation\n","\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","## References"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
